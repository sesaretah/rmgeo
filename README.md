# GEOJSON PIP API
Given a set of polygons and a point, this API checks wheter the point falls whithin one of polygons or not. This problem is well-known in computational geomtry as [point-in-polygon (PIP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_in_polygon) problem. The acceptable format for both point and area is the standardized GeoJson format.
